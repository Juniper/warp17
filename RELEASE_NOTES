v1.0:
-----
FEATURES:
1. HTTP 1.1 Client/Server Application traffic generation.
2. RAW TCP Client/Server Application traffic generation.
3. RAW UDP Client/Server Application traffic generation.
4. Python API for configuring, monitoring and controlling test cases.

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. When using a DUT (e.g., NAT device) between clients and servers, the
   sessions on the DUT should be cleared after every test. This is required
   because whenever a test-case stops, either because the pass-criteria was
   reached or because it was explicitly stopped, the connections are forcefully
   closed by WARP17 without performing the normal close sequence (e.g., no FIN is
   sent for TCP). The DUT will only clear the existing sessions once its local
   timeout expires.

2. Client test cases are automatically stopped when the pass-criteria is
   reached. This, however, is not the case for server test cases. The
   pass-criteria for server test-cases is to have all the servers up and
   waiting for connections. Therefore, even if a server test-case shows status
   PASSED it MUST still be explicitly stopped ("stop tests port <x>") when
   the user decides that the test has completed. This must be done in order to
   avoid keeping server connections established forever when the clients silently
   went down (e.g., when the client test case is manually stopped).

3. Limited ARP table + limited number of L3 interfaces (TPG_TEST_MAX_L3_INTF):
   only 10 interfaces supported per port for now

4. No VLAN support.

5. No TCP options or keep-alive support.

6. No IPv4 fragmentation support (neither on the send side nor on the receive
   side).

API CHANGES:
- Initial release
